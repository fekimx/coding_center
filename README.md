# csci33a - Web Programming with Python and JS

Dived deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap, covering database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, I learned and practiced to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. 

I completed the following projects:
- WIKI
- SEARCH
- MAIL
- COMMERCE & AUCTION
- SOCIAL MEDIA
- CODING CENTER (FINAL PROJECT)
- 
This was one of the most engaging and fruitful classes I have taken at HES!
